# **0.7.LD Workflow**

The **0.7.LD workflow** produces an instance segmentation of **lipid droplet object** from fluorescence confocal microscopy images. Using the workflow steps, you can adjust the parameters described below to improve the quality of your segmentation. 

⚠️ Make sure that the first character of the microscopy image layer name is not numeric

## EXTRACTION


### **0.7.1 | Select a channel for segmentation**

In this step, select the index of the lipid droplet channel in the input image. *Please note that the first channel is indexed as 0.*

Parameter:

-	`chan`: the index of the lipid droplet channel

## PREPROCESSING


### **0.7.2 | Rescale and smooth image**

This step first rescales the composite image’s intensity values from 0 to 1. Next a median and/or Gaussian filter *(for noise reduction)* to the composite image.


Parameters:
-	`median_size`: the radius of the median filter; a large radius produces a more blurred image.
-	`gauss_sigma`:  the size of the Gaussian kernel; a larger sigma value produces a more blurred image. 

❗ If you do not want to apply smoothing, set the parameter to 0.

## CORE


### **0.7.3 | Apply basic threshold**

This step applies the threshold of the user’s choice.

Parameters:
-	`method`: The type of thresholding method used to calculate the initial threshold value
-	`thresh_factor`: The ratio to be applied to the initial threshold value
-	`thresh_min`: The minimum value that can be used as a threshold
-	`thresh_max`: The maximum value that can be used as a threshold

❗ If you do not wish to adjust the threshold, set thresh_factor to 1.

## POSTPROCESSING


### **0.7.4 | Remove small holes and objects**

Small holes and objects are removed to clean up the segmentation in the penultimate step.

Parameters:
-	`hole_min`: the minimum width of the holes to be filled in the segmentation
-	`hole_max`: the maximum width of the holes to be filled in the segmentation
-	`min_size`: the minimum width of the objects to remain in the segmentation
-	`method`: determines if both filters are applied in 3D or on a 2D level *(slice by slice)*

❗ If the method drop-down menu is set to *“slice_by_slice”* the min_size, hole_min, and hole_max values are squared, if set to *“3D”* the values are cubed.

## POSTPOSTPROCESSING


### **0.7.5 | Label objects**

The final step labels each lipid droplet object with a unique integer starting at 1 *(0 represents the background)*. Individual objects are determined based on proximity. If they are joined by one pixel in any direction *(X,Y,Z, or diagonal)*, the objects are considered connected.  The labels are encoded as the intensity values of the object’s voxels.


### The lipid droplet segmentation workflow is now complete. The final layer can be saved using File > Save. 

### Batch processing: If you wish to utilize these settings on more than one image, or revisit the settings later, use the *“Save Workflow”* button at the bottom of the workflow editor. Be sure the settings file ends in *“LD”*.
