    "## **OBJECTIVE**\n",
    "\n",
    "After quantifying the organelle and region segmentations, we can also skeletonize these segmentations for additional morphological analysis. The purpose of this notebook is to break down infer-subc's skeletonization analysis in real time, step-by-step. As quoted by Dakai Jin et al. in their work titled *Skeletonization*, “Skeletonization provides a simple yet compact representation of an object while capturing its essential topologic and geometric features”. It can also be used to identify and distinguish organelle shapes. Supplementary metrics, including those related to skeleton shape, length, complexity, and connectivity, are added to the quantification output. Throughout the notebook, skeletons will be analyzed in a fashion that bears some resemblance to trees or node graphs in computer science. Therefore, some of the terminology is shared with these data science concepts. However, there are various nuanced differences; some terms will have an altered definition to match the needs of infer-subc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to describe in depth the morphology and distribution of the organelle skeletons in three-dimensional anisotropic data, building off of [Skan](https://skeleton-analysis.org/stable/index.html) (skeletonization python package) while also introducing new concepts."

    "- A numeric identification number given to every point in the skeleton, (path points do have node-ids)\n",
    "\n",
    "`Source Node`\n",

    "- A branch that begins at a point and cycles back to the same point (Cycle). There are two types of Cycles: a connected cycle has a singular junction node that is shared with another branch (for a simple example, imagine a lollipop). An isolated cycle is exclusively composed of path points, thus having zero nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Path`\n",
    "- A node to node pathway within a skeleton object (can be the same node). The pathway can include intermediate nodes in any order possible by the structure of the skeleton object.

    "`Punctate`\n",
    "- A type of skeleton object usually representing a blob-like or spherical organelle object. Absolute Punctates fall under this category; however, a skeleton object consisting of one endpoint to endpoint (Type 0) branch can also be deemed a punctate if the branch length is under a predetermined threshold. This is due to some spherical objects returning skeletons that are not absolute punctates, but endpoint to endpoint branches of minimal length.\n",
