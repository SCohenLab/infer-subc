    "# **Quality check segmentations**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Prior to this notebook, you should have already completed the organelle and masks segmentations using notebooks 1.0 through 1.7 and/or batch_processing_segmentations OR completed segmentations using the `infer-subc` plugin for Napari.***\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to:\n",
    "1. Visually inspect the segmentation outputs for each image in your dataset (***optional***)\n",
    "\n",
    "    We highly recommend going through this process. It is especially important for datasets where errors in the segmentations can have large impacts on the downstream statistical outcomes (e.g., datasets that do NOT have ~100+ images per condition for example).\n",
    "2. Separation of the `masks` file into separate `cell` and `nuc` segmentation files (***required***)\n",
    "\n",
    "    This is required for downstream analysis in `infer-subc` Part 2. For some background, this step is required due to technical limitations of the Napari plugin; each workflow can only output one file, but the segmentations of the nucleus and cell are derived from the same workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚û°Ô∏è **Input**\n",
    "The following files will be used as input in this notebook:\n",
    "1. \"Raw\" confocal microscopy image (\".tiff\", \".tif\", or \".czi\") where each channel of the image represents one of the organelles being segmented\n",
    "2. The segmentation files created in `infer-subc` Notebooks or Napari plugin or derived from alternative segmentation tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also need the following:\n",
    "1. An empty folder to save segmentation files after editing\n",
    "2. An empty folder to save the FINAL segmentation dataset (e.g., combining edited files with original segmentation files that did not need editing)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output** ‚û°Ô∏è\n",
    "The output from this notebook will include:\n",
    "1. A new folder containing any edited mask files saved as \".tiff\"\n",
    "2. A new folder containing ALL FINAL segmentation files that are ready for quantification\n",
