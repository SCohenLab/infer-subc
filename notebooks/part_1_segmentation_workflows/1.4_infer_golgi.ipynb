    "\n",
    "***Prior to this notebook, you should have already run through [1.0_image_setup](1.0_image_setup.ipynb).***\n",
    "\n",
    "In notebooks 1.2 through 1.7, we will go over the implementation of `infer-subc` in the a Napari plugin called  `organelle-segmenter-plugin`. The steps outlined in each notebook correlate to the workflow steps from the plugin. Here, you will gain knowledge of what `infer-subc` functions are involved in each of those steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "The segmentation workflows are completely independent of each other and can be run in any order. The current notebook segments the `Golgi`. Notesbook for the segmentation of other organelles can be found here:\n",
    "- Infer [`lysosomes`](1.2_infer_lysosome.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`mitochondria`](1.3_infer_mitochondria.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`peroxisomes`](1.5_infer_peroxisome.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`endoplasmic reticulum (ER)`](1.6_infer_ER.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`lipid droplets`](1.7_infer_lipid_droplet.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:** These notebooks do not include a batch processing option. They are simply explanations of the steps included in the Napari plugin. If you would like to batch process your images in a Jupyter notebook instead of the plugin, you can use the [batch process segmentation](batch_process_segmentations.ipynb) notebook.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Single cell analysis**\n",
    "Each workflow segments organelles from the entire image, irrespective of the cell mask identified in notebook 1.1. To attain a single-cell analysis, the mask will be applied to the organelle segmentation outputs before quantification in the `part_2_quantification` notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Golgi** üì¶‚úâÔ∏è\n",
    "The Golgi is a membrane-enclosed complex that is part of the secretory pathway. Proteins and lipids are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), transferred to the Golgi where they are modified as needed, and then packaged into vesicles for further transport throughout the cell. The Golgi also acts as a signaling hub for nutrient sensing, cell growth and metabolism, and is involved in organelle contacts with other membrane-bound organelles. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Fluorescence labeling strategies** üîÜ \n",
    "The Golgi can be fluorescently labeled in live and fixed cells by staining for endogenous proteins, targeting fluorescent proteins to the membrane or lumen using genertically encoded markers, or with dye-based approaches. The labeling approach used and resolution of your images can result in different staining outcomes that can impact the segmentation steps below. Additionally, sub-compartments within the Golgi have differing resident proteins making genetic and immunolabeling approaches nuanced. For example, labeling the GM130 protein will target the cis-Golgi while p230 will target the trans-Golgi network. These structures will likely have slightly different characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workflow was optimized for images of fluorescently tagged sialyltransferase 1 (SiT1), a Golgi membrane protein. The resulting Golgi structure has both the classical cisternae as well as small Golgi-derived vesicles; so we are utilizing two segmentation methods to idenfity the entire Golgi structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "***We advise that you test the segmentation process on a small, pilot dataset before committing to a particular labeling strategy and segmentation approach.***\n",
