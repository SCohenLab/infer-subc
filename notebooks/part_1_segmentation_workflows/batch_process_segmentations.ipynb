    "# **Batch Process Segmentations**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Prior to this notebook, you should have already run through [1.0_image_setup](1.0_image_setup.ipynb) and determined the best settings for your organelles of interest (minimum 1) and the masks.***\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, the settings determined in notebooks 1.1 through 1.7 we be used to batch process the segmentations for multiple images. The steps included here correlate to the `Batch Processor` module of the `infer-subc` Napari plugin called `organelle-segmenter-plugin`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è **Suggested Setup**\n",
    "We suggest that each the images from one experimental replicate be processed with the same settings, if possible. For analysis in `Part 2 - Organelle Quantification`, the segmentation files for each organelle across all images in an experimental replicate should be saved in the same folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚û°Ô∏è **Input**\n",
    "The following files and information will be necessary for batch processing segmentations:\n",
    "1. \"Raw\" confocal microscopy image (\".tiff\", \".tif\", or \".czi\") where each channel of the image represents one of the organelles being segmented\n",
    "2. The segementation settings for each workflow you wish to include in the batch processing (*Hint: these are deteremined in notebooks 1.1 through 1.7*)\n",
    "\n",
    "All of the organelles and the masks can be processed in the same batch processing session. However, if you wish to only include a subset that is fine. Keep in mind that the minimum necessary input for quantification is one masks workflow output and one organelle workflow output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Output** ‚û°Ô∏è\n",
    "The batch processing function will output one \".tiff\" segmentation file per workflow per image. They will be saved into the same output folder. The naming convention is to append the oragnelle or masks \"nickname\" used in the Napari plugin to the end of the raw file name.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîé **Quality Check and Mask Separation**\n",
    "After segmenting all the cells in your dataset, we recommend you quality check your segmentation results by visually inspecting the images. The Segmentation Validation pipeline is included in the [Full Quantification Pipeline Notebook](/notebooks/part_2_quantification/full_quantification_pipeline.ipynb) to streamline the validation process.\n",
