    "The `'methods_...'` notebooks included here in infer-subc Part 1: Segmentation Workflows will go over infer-subc-specific methods that are used across many of the segmentation workflows. The notebooks will explain each step in the method and display the combined function at the end of the notebook.\n",

    "In many instances, organelles of the same type are close enough together that they appear to be touching in microscopy images. When performing segmentation on images like this, multiple organelles will often appear as one continuous segmented object. To ensure accurate measurements of individual organelle volume, count, etc. are collected in Part 2, we must be able to accurately separate these connected organelles.\n",
    "\n",
    "By applying the declumping method presented below, we are able to more accurately separate the organelles that are connected to each other. The declumping process is based on the difference in intensity values between each object. They assume that the center points of each organelle will have the highest intensity values and the edges lower intensity values; divisions are made approximately equidistance between regions of high intensity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The assumption that the approximate center of an object has the highest intensity is true for some organelle labels, but not other. For example, when using a membrane-based label for organelles such as lysosomes, the center of the organelles can actually appear as lower intensity (almost 0 in some cases). In instances when the organelles are not uniform sizes or have multiple regions of high intensity each, such as for some mitochondrial staining, these large, complex objects can be incorrectly divided into multiple fragments. These instances will introduce a certain margin of error in the instance segmentation results. ***Caution should be used when determining the declumping settings to ensure a balance of over- and under-declumping is achieved.***\n",
    "\n",
    "***We advise that you test the declumping process on a small, pilot dataset before committing to a particular declumping strategy and segmentation approach as it is possible to over-declump images.***\n",
