    "### **Biological Relevance**\n",
    "Measurements of organelles and interaction sites use the masks that are provided by the segmentation workflows; however, sometimes the organelles that are segmented are grouped together due to high signals being too close together. By applying the declumping method here, we are able to separate the organelles that are in close proximity from each other, providing a better depiction of the organization of individual organelles of the same type within a cell. Additionally, by separating close proximity organelles in our segmentation, we gain an increased readout of organelle and interaction morphology metrics for the declumped organelles that are closer to the \"true\" makeup of the cell.\n",

    "***We advise that you test the declumping process on a small, pilot dataset before committing to a particular declumping strategy and segmentation approach as it is possible to over-declump images.***\n",
