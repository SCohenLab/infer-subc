    "# **Infer Soma And Neurites From Cellmask**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Prior to this notebook, you should have already run through [1.0_image_setup](1.0_image_setup.ipynb) and [1.1_infer_masks](1.1_infer_masks_from-composite_with_nuc.ipynb), [1.1a_infer_masks](1.1a_infer_masks_from-composite_single_cell.ipynb), or [1.1b_infer_masks](1.1b_infer_masks_from-composite_multiple-cells.ipynb).***\n",

    "### ➡️ **Input:**\n",
    "In this workflow, the neuron cellmask segmentation will be used to \"infer\" the locations of the soma (or cell body) and the neurites as separate objects based on their shape. No intensity images are necessary for this workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🍃 **Soma vs Neurites**\n",
    "Neurons are morphologically complex cell types containing mulitple subcellular regions that each carry out specific functions. One basic subregion classification discernable in most confocal microscopy images of a neuron is the distinction between the soma (or cell body) and the neurites (e.g., dendrites and axons). Here, the segmentation of the neurites from the soma is included to enable downstream comparisons of organelles between subregions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organelle morphology, distribution, and interactions have been shown to be distinct between different functional regions of cells. For example, the morphological differences in mitochondria between the soma and neurites of a neuron show larger mitochondria volume in neurites than in the soma of the same cell [[1](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8423436/)]. Golgi have also been shown to differ in distribution throughout a neuron at different stages of neuronal development as the golgi engages in dendritic golgi translocation, eventually leaving golgi outposts during neuronal maturation [[2](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2023.112709)]. Moreover, the interactions between ribosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum are more abundant in the soma and dendrites of neurons as compared to that of the axon [[3](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8143122/)].\n",
    "\n",
    "Comparing across distinct subregions enables specific phenotypes underlying cellular physiology to be linked to morphologically distinct subregions of cells. The organelle morphology, interactions, and distribution measurements carried out in [Part 2](/notebooks/part_2_quantification/) are carried out and summarized for the entire cell and within each subregion as part of the Organelle Signature Analysis.\n",
