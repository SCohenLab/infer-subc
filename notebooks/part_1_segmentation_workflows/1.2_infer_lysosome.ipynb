    "# **Infer `Lysosomes`**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Prior to this notebook, you should have already run through [1.0_image_setup](1.0_image_setup.ipynb).***\n",
    "\n",
    "In notebooks 1.2 through 1.7, we will go over the implementation of `infer-subc` in the a Napari plugin called  `organelle-segmenter-plugin`. The steps outlined in each notebook correlate to the workflow steps from the plugin. Here, you will gain knownledge of what `infer-subc` functions are involved in each of those steps. You can also utilize these notebooks to select which settings you'd like to use while batch processing your images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The segmentation workflows are completely independent of each other and can be run in any order. The current notebook segments the `Lysosomes`. Notesbooks for the segmentation of other organelles can be found here:\n",
    "- Infer [`mitochondria`](1.3_infer_mitochondria.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`golgi`](1.4_infer_golgi.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`peroxisomes`](1.5_infer_peroxisome.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`endoplasmic reticulum (ER)`](1.6_infer_ER.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`lipid droplets`](1.7_infer_lipid_droplet.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:** These notebooks do not include a batch processing option. They are simply explanations of the steps included in the Napari plugin. If you would like to batch process your images in a Jupyter notebook instead of the plugin, you can use: <mark> insert batch process segmentation notebook here </mark>*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Single cell analysis**\n",
    "Each workflow segments organelles from the entire image, irrespective of the cell mask identified in notebook 1.1. To attain a single-cell analysis, the mask will be applied to the organelle segmentation outputs before quantification in the `part_2_quantification` notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Lysosomes** üóëÔ∏è‚ôªÔ∏è\n",
    "Lysosomes are membrane-enclosed structures that contain enzymes and an acidic lumen for breaking down cellular components such as proteins, other organelles, and more. Degradative cargo can be obtained through endocytosis, the secretory pathway, and fusion with autophagosomes. Lysosomes can also act as secretory vesicles and are involved in organelles contacts with many other intracellular organelles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Fluorescence labeling strategies** üîÜ \n",
    "Lysosomes can be fluorescently labeled in live and fixed cells by staining for endogenous proteins, targeting fluorescent proteins to the membrane or lumen using genertically encoded markers, or with dye-based approaches. The labeling approach used and resolution of your images can result in different staining outcomes that can impact the segmentation steps below. For example, a genetically encoded fluorescent protein targeted to lysosomes using the membrane-associated Lamp1 protein (e.g., Lamp1-GFP) will specifically label the lyososomal membrane, not the lumen. In this case, large lysosomes may appear as empty rings or shells. In contrast, if a luminal dye is used, the structures will likely appear as a filled-in circle or sphere. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it can be challenging to differentiate between closely related vesicles within the endolysosomal system, like late endososomes and lysosomes. Therefore, understanding the coverage of your chosen marker is important in understanding the biological implication of results derived from this pipeline. \n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow below is best suited for segmentation of filled-in lysosome structures. When membrane-based labeling methods are used, the hollow structures are not always able to be filled in during segmentation, and, in some cases, regions of the shell structure enclosing the lysosomes aren't bright enough to segmented completely. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lysosome shapes can be spherical or take on a more elongated tube shape, so two segmentation methods to identify the wide range of object shapes is included. Read through the steps below for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "***We advise that you test the segmentation process on a small, pilot dataset before committing to a particular labeling strategy and segmentation approach.***\n",
