    "# Infer **`Mitochondria`**\n",
    "\n",
    "***Prior to this notebook, you should have already run through [1.0_image_setup](1.0_image_setup.ipynb).***\n",
    "\n",
    "In notebooks 1.2 through 1.7, we will go over the implementation of `infer-subc` in the a Napari plugin called  `organelle-segmenter-plugin`. The steps outlined in each notebook correlate to the workflow steps from the plugin. Here, you will gain knowledge of what `infer-subc` functions are involved in each of those steps. \n",
    "\n",
    "The segmentation workflows are completely independent of each other and can be run in any order. The current notebook segments the `Mitochondria`. Notebooks for the segmentation of other organelles can be found here:\n",
    "- Infer [`lysosomes`](1.2_infer_lysosome.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`golgi`](1.4_infer_golgi.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`peroxisomes`](1.5_infer_peroxisome.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`endoplasmic reticulum (ER)`](1.6_infer_ER.ipynb)\n",
    "- Infer [`lipid droplets`](1.7_infer_lipid_droplet.ipynb)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:** These notebooks do not include a batch processing option. They are simply explanations of the steps included in the Napari plugin. If you would like to batch process your images in a Jupyter notebook instead of the plugin, you can use the [batch process segmentation](batch_process_segmentations.ipynb) notebook.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Single cell analysis**\n",
    "Each workflow segments organelles from the entire image, irrespective of the cell mask identified in notebook 1.1. To attain a single-cell analysis, the mask will be applied to the organelle segmentation outputs before quantification in the `part_2_quantification` notebooks. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Mitochondria**üîã\n",
    "Mitochondria are membrane enclosed structures comprised of an outter member that surrounds the inner member or cristea. This double-membrane structure is critical for mitochondria to produce ATP. Mitochondria are also important in intracellular calcium regulation, programmed cell death (e.g., apoptosis), and more. The sturucture of mitochondria are highly regulated through fission and fusion. They are also involved in organelle contacts with most other membrane-bound organelles to coordinate and regulate organellar functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Fluorescence labeling strategies** üîÜ \n",
    "Mitochondria can be fluorescently labeled in live and fixed cells by staining for endogenous proteins, targeting fluorescent proteins to the outter membrane, inner membrane, intermembrane space (between the inner and outter membranes), or matrix (inside the inner membrane) using genetically encoded markers, or with dye-based approaches. The labeling approach used and resolution of your images can result in different staining outcomes that can impact the segmentation steps below.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a genetically encoded fluorescent protein targeted to the outer mitochondria membrane using the TOMM20 protein (e.g., Tomm20-GFP) may result in a hollow tube shaped organelle while a dye-based marker that fills the intermembrane space and matrix would produce a filled-in structure. The workflow below was optimized for images that contain filled-in mitochondria.\n",
    "\n",
    "The size and shape of a mitochondrion can range from a long filament to a small sphere depending on the cell state and stress levels. Therefore, we are utilizing two segmentation methods to idenfity all mitochondria. Read through the steps below for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "***We advise that you test the segmentation process on a small, pilot dataset before committing to a particular labeling strategy and segmentation approach.***\n",
